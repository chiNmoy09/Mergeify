Mergeify is an Android application that allows users to merge multiple PDF files into a single document and edit PDFs by removing specific pages before saving them. Built using Kotlin and iTextPDF, this app simplifies PDF management with an intuitive interface.

## NOTE

This repository is still under development and I will continue to add more features to it.

## Key Features

- **Merge PDFs** – Select up to 10 PDFs and combine them into one.
- **Edit PDFs** – Remove unwanted pages from a PDF and save the modified version.
- **File Management** – Save the merged/edited PDFs in the device's storage.
- **Easy Preview** – Open the merged or edited PDF directly from the app.
- **Modern UI** – User-friendly interface with smooth animations.
  
Built with Kotlin, Room Database, DataBinding, and RecyclerView for a seamless user experience.
